## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* Explain the purpose of the analysis.
  - I conducted the following project by following the Data analysis process. With that being said the first thing I did was to discover  the ultimate question or problem we are trying to answer and actually understand it as well. What I took from the project was to find a way to identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.
  - The second step I took was to prepare the data. I first looked at the data source that was given and then displayed my data via jupyter notebook to view the columns and rows present and seeing if it is cleaned up enough to read.  
* Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict.
  - 
* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).
* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any resampling method).

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.



* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
